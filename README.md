# VIVE | Chrome Built-In AI API Extension

A chrome extension that leverages the prompt and summarizer APIs to provide an engaging interaction with what we read on the internet


# Inspiration
What really sparked my motivation to make such extension is the current situation where people on the internet have become numbers. Everyday thousands are dying, starving, and suffering, some of them are children. Yet the human eye has normalized these scenes. Scenes that if we would imagine our own friends and families are going through we would get up from our places leaving everything behind our back. 

I put the'Add Image' functionality so people can see the little kids when they are reading about them, to see how they look like and compare them to their own kids or siblings.
Technology makes our lives easier but that doesn't mean it's 'better'. This project is a desperate call to invite people to have think and reflect thoroughly on what they are reading. Summarizing is never the purpose, as the human essence is so complex and It's unjust for it to be squished into a couple of sentences. 
No matter how much pros my project has, if the user doesn't have the will to know and learn, then this is just another 'note taker' on the internet.
